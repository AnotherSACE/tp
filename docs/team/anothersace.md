### My role
- My initial role in the group was to get the team together for meetings and work on the idea behind our project.
- I also helped create most of the user stories and some of the user requirements.
- As time passed, I found that my team wanted to contribute bits by themselves. It was hard to keep up with everybodyâ€™s work due to a lack of communication, so we all went our own individual paths implementing parts of the projects as we saw fit.
